I have provided Makefiles to allow building using the nmake tool (from MS VC).

NB: To set the necessary environment variables (without which the build will certainly screw!), go to your VC (Visual C++)
installation bin directory and run the vcvars32.bat script. Check http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f2ccy3wt.aspx for
more information on this.

To build everything (inlinederous static lib itself, tests, sample clients, etc.) simply open a command-prompt and type:
	
	nmake

To build tests, type:

	nmake test


When you are done building, check the bin and lib folders.
